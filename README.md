Navigation:
The navigation of the website consists of a simple nav bar with links to the Home Page, History, and Visit sections. I added the mexican flag to the nav bar and a hover feature for the links.

Layout:
The layout of each page follows a clean and organized structure with a simple clean title and a different background image depending on the page. The content is divided into sections with clear headings. Each section has images to make it more eye friendly. Responsive design principles are applied to ensure that the website looks good and functions well across different devices and screen sizes.

Colour Choices:
The colour scheme of the website is inspired by the vibrant culture and history of Mexico City. Warm tones such as terracotta and goldenrod are used for the headers and buttons to evoke a sense of energy and warmth. Soft pastel colours are used for the content boxes. 

Challenges Faced:
One of the main challenges faced during the design process was ensuring responsiveness across different devices. This involved carefully adjusting the layout, font sizes, and image sizes to ensure that the website looks good and functions properly on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. 
Another challenge was selecting appropriate images and ensuring they fit well within their respective containers while maintaining responsiveness.
